"""Live counterpart to what `action.yml`/`combine.py` already do for the
batch/static case: run mcp-doctor's checks always, mcp-fuzz's and
mcp-reality-check's on every real call — but for an agent's actual
session, not a CI run.

`GuardedSession` wraps a real `ClientSession` and composes all three
trilogy tools' live gates at their natural point: mcp-doctor's
registration checks once at discovery (`list_tools`), mcp-fuzz's latency/
size gate and mcp-reality-check's correctness checks together on every
real call (`call_tool`) — **one** real network call per tool call, not
three, by construction. `mcp_fuzz.gate.guarded_call` and `mcp_reality_
check.gate.LatencyGate.timed_call` (well, the reverse — see each
package's own gate module) each make their own call-and-check round
trip; calling both here would mean two real network calls per logical
call, which for a non-idempotent or destructive tool isn't just
wasteful, it's actively wrong. Instead, this makes the call exactly once
and fans the one real response out to each sibling package's own already-
pure, already-tested per-response functions (`LatencyGate.record`,
`mcp_reality_check.checks.*`) — the same functions their own wrappers
call internally, reused here instead of duplicated.
